# Top Rock 

Top Rock is an application helping users discover top rock bands of all time. The users will be prompted with a login/sing up form where they would have to create an account and log in, after the successful log in users will be prompted with a list of artists where they could pick a band of interest that they want to discover more about and have conversations about that particular band.After choosing an artist the users will see an image header with the band, a description about the band and the members of the band then right below the description section there are the bands album images all displayed in a carousel all fetched from MongoDB, the last section is a comment panel where users can discuss interesting thinks about the band.
